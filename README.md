# Django Vue Prototype Repository

## Specs:
- django backend
- vue.js frontend
- should be extensible
- testing (unit, integration & e2e)
- easy deployment (local, docker, kubernetes possibly)

## MVP:
- one page which shows an image and text from an api (async)
- one endpoint that has a delayed calculation and gives back a random number (per subscription, maybe with graphql? moleculer?)
